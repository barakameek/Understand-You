# Understand-You

Persona Alchemy Lab — a client-side JavaScript app for exploring persona elements and concept mapping.

This repository contains static web assets (HTML/CSS/JS) and artwork.

What I did: added this README and an MIT LICENSE to improve discoverability.

Next suggested improvements:
- Add a concise README with usage and development instructions (I can expand).
- Consider adding a package.json and build tooling for dependency management.
- Reduce large placeholder assets or move to a compressed / external hosting if needed.
- Add a license file (MIT) — committed here.
