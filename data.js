    "Attraction": {
        name: "Attraction Focus: The Spark Plug",
        coreQuestion: "Seriously, who or what flips *your* switch?",
        coreConcept: "Think of this as your personal 'Desire Compass'. What actually *points* you towards sexy feelings? It's more than just gender – it could be someone's vibe, a specific situation, a shared brainwave, or even cool objects or ideas.",
        elaboration: "Yeah, it covers the usual suspects (straight, gay, bi, pan), but also the whole amazing Asexuality spectrum (where attraction might be low-key or absent) and Demisexuality (needing that deep connection first). Plus, maybe you're drawn to brainiacs (hello, Sapiosexuals!), certain power vibes, specific looks, or even super specific things like latex or scenarios (sometimes called fetishes – we explore 'em all judgment-free here!).",
        scoreInterpretations: {
            "Very Low": "Your Spark Plug might run cool! Strong Asexual vibes here – maybe attraction isn't really your jam, or it pops up rarely and isn't tied to specific things. Totally cool!",
            "Low": "Less about specific targets, more about the *feeling*. Maybe you need that deep Demisexual bond first, or your desire tends to respond rather than initiate. Your spark is selective!",
            "Moderate": "A pretty common setting! You might vibe with familiar things like gender or style, be open to lots of people (Pan-leaning maybe?), or need *some* connection but not necessarily a soul-bond first.",
            "High": "Ooh, a strong pull! You likely have specific types, dynamics (brains? power?), or even certain objects/materials/situations that really get your engine going. Hello, focused desire!",
            "Very High": "Laser focus! Your attraction might be super specific to a narrow group, OR certain objects, materials, vibes, or scenarios are absolute *must-haves* to light your fire. This is where strong fetishes live!"
        },
        examples: "Think stuff like: Asexuality, Demisexuality, Straight, Gay, Bi, Pan, Sapiosexuals, Fetishes (latex, feet, uniforms – you name it!), digging certain body types, getting turned on by D/s roles.",
        personaConnection: "What this means for *your* unique sexy magic: Defines the 'who' or 'what' gets your attention."
    },
    "Interaction": {
        name: "Interaction Style: The Dance Floor",
        coreQuestion: "How do you like to move and groove during sexy times?",
        coreConcept: "This is all about your preferred 'dance moves' in the bedroom (or wherever!). Are you leading, following, or improvising together? What's the energy like?",
        elaboration: "Covers the whole spectrum from taking charge to happily following along. Do you like things equal, or is a power difference your jam? Includes vibes like being nurturing, playful, commanding, serving, or even putting on a bit of a show. Think: Dom, Sub, Switch, Top, Bottom, Caregiver, etc.",
        scoreInterpretations: {
            "Very Low": "Leaning back feels good! You likely love yielding control, following clear steps, serving, or being totally taken care of. Strong Submissive energy!",
            "Low": "Happy to let others lead the dance! You might prefer supporting roles or focusing on receiving pleasure more than directing it. Submissive or Bottom vibes likely.",
            "Moderate": "Let's dance together! You probably enjoy give-and-take, maybe swapping who leads (hello, Switches!), or keeping things playful and mutual.",
            "High": "Ready to lead! You enjoy taking charge, guiding the flow, dishing out sensation or care, or being the star of the show. Dominant, Top, or Caregiver energy shining through.",
            "Very High": "You *thrive* on being in the driver's seat! Giving clear directions, commanding the scene, or fully embodying a powerful Dominant role feels right. Maybe you love seeing your partner react!"
        },
        examples: "Think stuff like: D/s (Dominance/submission), M/s (Master/slave), Top/Bottom/Versatile, Primal Play (getting growly!), Service stuff, Show-offs & Watchers (Exhibitionism/Voyeurism), Teacher/Student vibes, Caregiver/Little dynamics (DDlg/MDlb).",
        personaConnection: "What this means for *your* unique sexy magic: Defines your favorite way to 'partner up' and share energy."
    },
    "Sensory": {
        name: "Sensory Emphasis: The Feeling Finder",
        coreQuestion: "What physical sensations make you go 'Ooh!' or 'Aah!'?",
        coreConcept: "This is all about how much *physical feeling* matters to you – the type, the intensity, the whole shebang. Touch, temperature, textures, pressure, even sights, sounds, and smells!",
        elaboration: "Covers everything your senses pick up! Light touches, firm grips, maybe even a little impact? Hot wax, cool ice? Smooth silk, rough rope? Tight squeezes, gentle vibrations? Plus, how sights, sounds, or smells play into it. It also includes the whole spectrum from pure pleasure to playing with pain or intensity (like in BDSM).",
        scoreInterpretations: {
            "Very Low": "Feelings are meh? Physical stuff might be way less important than the emotional vibe or the mental game for you. Intense sensations are probably a 'no thanks'.",
            "Low": "Gentle does it! You likely prefer soft, warm, affectionate, or 'vanilla' sensations. Comfort is key, intense stuff is usually off the table.",
            "Moderate": "You enjoy the classics! A good range of pleasant physical feelings is nice. Maybe you're curious about *mild* intensity (a light spank?), but it's not the main event.",
            "High": "Sensation Seeker! You actively look for specific, strong, or unique physical feelings. Think impact play, temperature games, specific textures (latex!), light bondage, or really zoning in on pleasure spots.",
            "Very High": "INTENSITY NOW! You might *need* strong, specific, or even extreme sensations. Heavy BDSM play (impact, needles, wax - handled safely!), tight bondage, sensory overload/deprivation, or a powerful focus on *very* specific triggers could be your jam."
        },
        examples: "Think stuff like: Gentle massage, deep kisses, cuddles, BDSM impact (flogging, caning), wax play, ice cubes, rope bondage (Shibari!), blindfolds, e-stim toys, loving the feel of specific fabrics.",
        personaConnection: "What this means for *your* unique sexy magic: Defines how your body likes to experience pleasure (or interesting intensity!)."
    },
    "Psychological": {
        name: "Psychological Driver: The Heart's Quest",
        coreQuestion: "Beyond the physical, *why* sex? What deep-down need does it scratch?",
        coreConcept: "This digs into the core reasons *behind* the sexy times. What emotional, mental, or even soul-level needs does it help you meet or express?",
        elaboration: "It's about the deeper 'why'. Is it about connection (intimacy, trust, vulnerability)? Power (control, surrender)? Self-expression (creativity, validation)? Changing your state (escape, catharsis, stress relief)? Or finding comfort and security?",
        scoreInterpretations: {
            "Very Low": "Maybe sex is mostly about physical release or just plain fun for you? Deeper psychological itches might get scratched elsewhere.",
            "Low": "The emotional side is nice, but maybe not the main focus. Fun, stress relief, or light connection could be the usual drivers.",
            "Moderate": "A healthy mix! Sex probably ticks several boxes – connection, stress relief, fun, feeling good about yourself – alongside the physical enjoyment.",
            "High": "Sex is a key channel for meeting specific, important inner needs. You might consciously (or unconsciously) seek out intimacy, power exchange, validation, or emotional release through it.",
            "Very High": "Hitting that deep psychological spot is *the point*. If core needs like total surrender, absolute control, deep vulnerability, or escaping reality aren't met, the experience might feel hollow."
        },
        examples: "Think stuff like: Using sex mainly to de-stress (Low/Moderate), building deep emotional bonds through intimacy (High), using BDSM for power exchange or letting off steam (High/Very High), needing to feel desired/validated (High), chasing intense 'out of body' feelings (Very High).",
        personaConnection: "What this means for *your* unique sexy magic: Defines the emotional 'why' behind your sexual expression."
    },
    "Cognitive": {
        name: "Cognitive Engagement: The Mind Palace",
        coreQuestion: "How much headspace does sex take up? Is it all about fantasy, scenarios, and brainpower?",
        coreConcept: "This measures how much your *mind* gets involved. Are you all about being present in the moment, or do fantasies, stories, psychological games, or witty banter fuel your fire?",
        elaboration: "Includes everything from being totally zoned into physical sensations to having elaborate fantasy worlds, playing out detailed roles, loving mind games, or getting turned on by clever talk or the *idea* of a dynamic.",
        scoreInterpretations: {
            "Very Low": "Headspace clear! You prefer being fully present and feeling things physically and emotionally. Complex fantasies or analyzing things might just pull you out of the moment.",
            "Low": "Mostly here and now! You enjoy the immediate sensations. Maybe a light scenario pops into your head, but you're not relying on a big internal movie.",
            "Moderate": "Mind + Body synergy! You can enjoy being present, but also appreciate some mental spice – maybe occasional role-play, dirty talk that paints a picture, or getting into the psychology of it.",
            "High": "Your brain is a major erogenous zone! Detailed fantasies, specific role-play scenarios, playing with power dynamics mentally, or sharp, sexy banter really amps things up for you.",
            "Very High": "Welcome to the Mind Palace! Your arousal might *depend* on intricate scenarios, complex fantasy worlds, intense psychological play (mind games!), or the sheer *concept* of what's happening. The story in your head is key."
        },
        examples: "Think stuff like: Mindful, connected touch (Low), loving descriptive dirty talk (Moderate), detailed D/s scenes with rules (High/Very High), fantasy LARP-style encounters (High/Very High), getting off on writing/reading complex erotica (High/Very High), intense psychological manipulation play (Very High).",
        personaConnection: "What this means for *your* unique sexy magic: Defines how much your thoughts and imagination get in on the action."
    },
    "Relational": {
        name: "Relational Context: The Constellation",
        coreQuestion: "What's your ideal setup? Who do you connect with, and how?",
        coreConcept: "This describes your preferred 'social map' for sex and relationships. How many partners? How much commitment? Strangers or soulmates? One-on-one or group hangs?",
        elaboration: "Covers the whole range: flying solo, traditional monogamy, different flavors of ethical non-monogamy (like polyamory or open relationships), group fun, and everything in between. It's about the structure you thrive in.",
        scoreInterpretations: {
            "Very Low": "Solo voyages or a 'just us two' liftoff! You likely prefer masturbation or a deeply bonded, exclusive partnership. Multiple partners or casual stuff might not appeal.",
            "Low": "Team Monogamy! You generally prefer and seeks monogamous, committed relationships as the ideal context for sexual expression. Casual sex is less appealing or infrequent.",
            "Moderate": "Flexible connections! Maybe you're comfy in a duo but open to possibilities (like swinging sometimes, or dating around before settling down), or value deep bonds without needing strict lifelong exclusivity. Exploring non-monogamy or happy being Solo Poly?",
            "High": "More the merrier (consensually)! You prefer or practice structures involving multiple partners or explicit openness, such as Open Relationships or various forms of Polyamory (hierarchical or not). Communication about connections is key.",
            "Very High": "Charting your own course! You might lean towards Relationship Anarchy (no set rules!), embrace non-hierarchical Polyamory, enjoy group dynamics, or feel comfortable with different levels of commitment and connection across various partners. 'One size fits all' doesn't work for you."
        },
        examples: "Think stuff like: Masturbation, Serial Monogamy, Lifelong Monogamy, Friends With Benefits, Open Relationships, Swinging, Triads/Quads, Hierarchical Polyamory, Egalitarian Polyamory, Solo Polyamory, Relationship Anarchy, Group Sex, Anonymous hookups.",
        personaConnection: "What this means for *your* unique sexy magic: Defines your ideal 'relationship constellation' (or lack thereof!)."
