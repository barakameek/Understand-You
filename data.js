    "Attraction": {
        name: "Attraction Focus: The Spark Plug",
        coreQuestion: "Seriously, who or what truly flips *your* switch? What unique signal lights that initial pilot light of desire within you?",
        coreConcept: "Think of this as your personal 'Desire Compass,' forged in the heart-fires of *you* and reacting to the world's subtle energies. What genuinely *points* you towards sexy feelings or intimate curiosity? It's way more complex than just gender – it could be the electric hum of someone's specific vibe, a charged situation crackling with potential, a sudden meeting of minds ('brainwave sync!'), or even captivating objects, compelling ideas, or symbolic aesthetics. What makes your compass needle *sing* and spin?",
        elaboration: "Sure, it covers the familiar landmarks on the map – straight, gay, bi, pan attraction patterns based on gender. But our exploration delves into the whole, vibrant Asexuality spectrum (where attraction might whisper softly, appear only under rare cosmic alignments, or be entirely absent, which is perfectly valid!) and the intriguing territory of Demisexuality (where the compass only awakens after forging a deep, resonant emotional connection, like needing a key to unlock the mechanism). Beyond that, maybe your needle leaps for brilliant minds (hello, Sapiosexuals!), quivers in the presence of certain power dynamics (authority or vulnerability?), gets magnetically pulled by specific physical forms or aesthetics, or goes absolutely wild for very particular things like the second-skin gleam of latex, the specific shape of a foot, or intricate scenarios (sometimes called fetishes – we catalogue 'em all here, judgment-free, like curious alchemists documenting magical ingredients!).",
        scoreInterpretations: {
            "Very Low": "Your Spark Plug hums at a cool, steady frequency! Strong Asexual vibrations resonate here – perhaps sexual attraction isn't a major force shaping your interactions, or it manifests as a rare comet, appearing briefly and not tied to predictable orbits. This indicates a self-contained energy, powerful in its own right!",
            "Low": "Less about specific targets, more about the *resonant frequency* or a specific *context*. Maybe you need that deep Demisexual soul-bond before the spark truly ignites, requiring trust and emotional intimacy as fuel. Or perhaps your desire prefers to respond rather than initiate, like a perfectly tuned instrument waiting for the right note from a trusted player. Your spark is discerning and values connection.",
            "Moderate": "A common and incredibly versatile setting for your compass! You might resonate with familiar energies like gender expression or style, find your compass spinning happily for many kinds of people (Pan-curious, perhaps?), or need *some* level of connection or shared vibe, but not necessarily a soul-merging epic before feeling a pull. You navigate the world with a well-rounded map of attraction.",
            "High": "Ooh, a strong magnetic pull towards specific 'true norths'! You likely have clearly defined types, dynamics (brains? authority? artistic flair? vulnerability?), or even certain objects, materials (like leather or lace), or situations that reliably get your inner engine revving. Your desire has clear destinations it wants to explore!",
            "Very High": "Laser focus! Your attraction might be incredibly specific, homing in on a narrow band of individuals defined by unique traits, OR certain objects, materials, vibes, or scenarios are non-negotiable *ley lines* that *must* be present to truly light your fire. This is where potent fetishes often reside, acting as powerful catalysts or essential ingredients in your personal alchemy of desire."
        },
        examples: "Think energies like: Asexuality (Absence/Low intensity/Rare occurrence of sexual attraction), Demisexuality (Emotional bond prerequisite!), Straight, Gay, Bi, Pan (Gender factors in attraction), Sapiosexuals (Intelligence is fire!), Fetishes (Latex allure, Foot focus, Uniform power – endless possibilities!), attraction to specific body types/features, magnetic pull towards certain D/s roles, the captivating nature of Androgyny.",
        personaConnection: "How this shapes *your* unique sexy magic: It fundamentally defines the 'who', 'what', 'when', or 'vibe' that first captures your attention and draws you in, the initial ingredients needed to begin brewing your unique potion of desire."
    },
    "Interaction": {
        name: "Interaction Style: The Dance Floor",
        coreQuestion: "How do you naturally love to move and groove when connecting intimately? What's your signature rhythm, your preferred way of sharing energy?",
        coreConcept: "This explores your preferred 'choreography' in the intimate space (be it a cozy bedroom, a dedicated dungeon, or a sun-dappled forest clearing!). Are you instinctively drawn to leading the dance, setting the pace and guiding the steps with confidence (Dominance)? Or do you find profound bliss in following, surrendering to the music and your partner's lead (Submission)? Perhaps you're a master of improvisation, seamlessly weaving moves together, sometimes leading, sometimes following (Switching)? What's the energetic pulse and structure of your ideal dance?",
        elaboration: "It covers the entire dynamic spectrum, from confidently taking the reins and directing the scene (Dominance) to joyfully yielding control and trusting the flow (Submission). Do you thrive on a sense of equality and perfectly mirrored steps, or does a clear power difference make the music soar and feel more exciting? This includes nuanced energies like being a nurturing Caregiver, a playful Tease, a commanding Presence, a devoted Servant focused on pleasure, or even a dazzling Performer who thrives on being watched. Think: Dom, Sub, Switch, Top, Bottom, Caregiver, Primal Player, Exhibitionist, etc.",
        scoreInterpretations: {
            "Very Low": "Leaning back into the music, feeling supported and guided, feels absolutely divine! You likely adore yielding control, following intricate or clear steps, serving with devotion, or being completely swept off your feet and cared for. Resonant Submissive energy sings strongly here, finding freedom in following.",
            "Low": "Happy to let others lead the choreography! You might find deep satisfaction in supporting roles, focusing intently on the bliss of receiving pleasure, or responding beautifully to clear cues rather than directing the overall flow. Submissive or Bottom vibrations likely feel like comfortable, familiar ground.",
            "Moderate": "Let's improvise a stunning duet! You probably enjoy a fluid give-and-take, perhaps swapping the lead role effortlessly and playfully (hello, versatile Switches!), or keeping the energy collaborative, mutual, and highly responsive. Partnership in motion, co-creating the dance!",
            "High": "Ready to step forward and lead the way! You relish taking charge, guiding the flow of energy and sensation, generously dishing out carefully chosen pleasures or devoted care, or perhaps being the undeniable star of the show, directing the spotlight. Dominant, Top, or Caregiver energy shines brightly through you.",
            "Very High": "You *thrive* being the conductor of this intimate orchestra! Giving precise directions, commanding the entire atmosphere, meticulously crafting the experience, or fully embodying a potent, authoritative Dominant role feels utterly natural and deeply satisfying. Perhaps witnessing your partner's ecstatic reaction is the sweetest music of all!"
        },
        examples: "Think dynamics like: D/s (Dominance/submission power exchange), M/s (Master/slave - often a deeper, lifestyle commitment), Top/Bottom/Versatile (Positional, energetic, or task-oriented roles), Primal Play (getting growly, instinctive!), Service devotion (finding joy in pleasing), Show-offs & Watchers (Exhibitionism/Voyeurism), Teacher/Student dynamics (knowledge exchange play), Caregiver/Little connections (nurturing/dependent roles like DDlg/MDlb etc).",
        personaConnection: "How this shapes *your* unique sexy magic: It defines your favorite way to 'partner up' and engage, how you prefer to share energy, and how you express or experience power, control, and surrender within the dance of intimacy."
    },
    "Sensory": {
        name: "Sensory Emphasis: The Feeling Finder",
        coreQuestion: "What specific physical sensations make your whole being sigh 'Ooh yes!' or gasp 'More!'? What tunes your body's strings to the frequency of pleasure or intense awareness?",
        coreConcept: "This is your personal 'Sensitivity Dial,' measuring how crucial *physical feeling* is in your intimate experiences. We're not just talking about orgasm; we mean the entire sensory symphony – the quality of touch (light vs. firm), temperature contrasts (hot wax, cool metal), intriguing textures (smooth silk, rough rope), specific pressures (tight binds, gentle squeezes), and even the subtle influence of sights, sounds, and smells that weave into the moment and heighten arousal.",
        elaboration: "Covers the entire landscape your physical senses explore! Gossamer-light touches that tease nerve endings, grounding firm grips that convey presence, maybe the resonant thud or sharp sting of impact play? The intriguing contrast of hot wax dripping slowly versus the shocking chill of ice cubes? The glide of smooth silk across skin versus the rough, secure embrace of rope? Tight squeezes that paradoxically feel like safety, gentle vibrations that hum with electric pleasure? Plus, how evocative sights (candlelight, specific aesthetics), resonant sounds (music, breath, words), or specific smells (perfume, leather, clean sweat) play their part. It also explicitly includes the whole spectrum from seeking pure, unadulterated pleasure to intentionally playing with pain or intensity (as in BDSM), finding fascination and release in the body's complex responses.",
        scoreInterpretations: {
            "Very Low": "Feelings are... interesting, but maybe background noise? Direct physical input might be far less important than the emotional resonance, the intricate mental game, or the overall connection for you. Intense or extreme sensations are likely a firm 'thanks, but no thanks' territory. You connect through other channels primarily.",
            "Low": "Gentle currents and soft melodies preferred! You likely favor soft, warm, affectionate, or 'vanilla' sensations where comfort is paramount. Intense physical experiences, pain, or jarring contrasts are usually off the map. You seek solace, connection, and ease through sensation.",
            "Moderate": "You appreciate the well-loved classics and a varied sensory menu! A satisfying range of pleasant physical feelings is definitely welcome and enhances the experience. Maybe you're curious about *mild* intensity (a playful spank? a light scratch? temperature tease?), but it’s not the headliner, just part of the delightful ensemble cast.",
            "High": "Dedicated Sensation Seeker reporting for duty! You actively pursue specific, potent, or unique physical feelings that truly capture your attention. Think deliberate impact play, intriguing temperature games that wake up the skin, the specific allure of textures (hello, latex, velvet, or rope!), light bondage adding focus and vulnerability, or really zoning in on those exquisite pleasure points with dedicated skill.",
            "Very High": "INTENSITY IS THE LANGUAGE YOUR BODY SPEAKS! You might *crave* strong, specific, or even extreme sensations to feel truly engaged, present, and alive. Heavy BDSM play (impact that leaves marks, needle play, hot wax artistry - all practiced with meticulous safety!), constrictive bondage that alters consciousness, deliberate sensory overload/deprivation techniques, or a powerful, unwavering focus on *very* specific physical triggers could be your core pathway to profound experience."
        },
        examples: "Think experiences like: A slow, gentle massage melting away the mundane world, deep soul-searching kisses that taste like forever, cozy cuddles that feel like coming home, BDSM impact (flogging's hypnotic rhythm, caning's sharp declaration), wax play creating temporary art on skin, ice cube trails leaving paths of fire, intricate rope bondage (Shibari!), blindfolds heightening every other nerve ending, e-stim's unique electric tingle, loving the specific feel of certain fabrics (leather, silk, fur, denim) against skin.",
        personaConnection: "How this shapes *your* unique sexy magic: It defines how your physical body deciphers the complex and fascinating language of pleasure, pain, intensity, and pure sensation."
    },
    "Psychological": {
        name: "Psychological Driver: The Heart's Quest",
        coreQuestion: "Beyond the undeniable physical thrill, *why* intimacy for you, truly? What deep-down soul-need does it satisfy, what inner quest does it fuel, what core part of you does it allow to be expressed?",
        coreConcept: "This digs into the resonant core motivations, the profound 'why' *behind* the intimate encounters. What emotional longings, mental explorations, or even soul-level quests does intimacy help you embark on or fulfill? What essential inner landscape does it illuminate, nourish, or allow you to traverse?",
        elaboration: "It's about the deeper purpose, the engine driving the experience. Is it primarily about forging profound <strong>connection</strong> (deep intimacy, unwavering trust, shared vulnerability that builds bridges)? Exploring the fascinating terrain of <strong>power</strong> dynamics (claiming control, finding freedom in surrender, the dance of service)? A vital channel for <strong>self-expression</strong> (unleashing creativity, receiving validation, the relief of being truly *seen*)? A potent way to intentionally <strong>shift your state</strong> (finding escape from stress, experiencing catharsis, achieving blissful release)? Or seeking fundamental <strong>comfort, safety, and security</strong> in the sanctuary of another's presence?",
        scoreInterpretations: {
            "Very Low": "Perhaps sex is primarily about delightful physical release, pure unadulterated fun, or simply scratching a biological or stress-induced itch? Deeper psychological quests and soul-level needs might find their answers, nourishment, or expression primarily in other realms of your life.",
            "Low": "The emotional side provides a pleasant harmony, a lovely background score, but maybe not the main melody driving the experience. Fun, effective stress relief, or light, uncomplicated connection could be the usual drivers, keeping the psychological stakes relatively low.",
            "Moderate": "A healthy, balanced ecosystem where body and mind intertwine! Sex likely fulfills several important needs – fostering connection, melting stress, sparking joy, feeling affirmed – existing comfortably alongside, and enhancing, the pure physical enjoyment. A well-rounded and adaptable 'why'.",
            "High": "Intimacy serves as a key portal, a primary channel for meeting specific, vital inner needs. You might consciously (or unconsciously) seek out situations that offer deep vulnerability, allow for explicit power exchange, provide potent validation, or facilitate significant emotional release primarily through sexual expression and connection.",
            "Very High": "Hitting that profound psychological note, satisfying that core need, is *the entire point*, the absolute heart of the matter. If fundamental requirements like achieving total surrender, wielding absolute (consensual) control, experiencing deep soul-baring vulnerability, or completely escaping the mundane world aren't met, the experience might feel strangely hollow, incomplete, or unsatisfying, regardless of how physically pleasant it was."
        },
        examples: "Think motivations like: Using sex mainly as a reliable tool to de-stress after a demanding week (Low/Moderate), intentionally building unbreakable emotional bonds and trust through shared physical intimacy (High), engaging in specific BDSM practices for cathartic power exchange or profound emotional release (High/Very High), needing potent validation of your desirability, skill, or worthiness through a partner's reaction (High), chasing intense 'out of body' flow states or ego dissolution through sensation and connection (Very High).",
        personaConnection: "How this shapes *your* unique sexy magic: It defines the emotional 'why', the deep-seated motivations, core needs, and soul-level quests that fuel your sexual expression and drive your search for meaningful connection."
    },
    "Cognitive": {
        name: "Cognitive Engagement: The Mind Palace",
        coreQuestion: "How much of the action happens in your headspace? Is your brain a primary erogenous zone, buzzing with elaborate fantasies, strategic scenarios, complex analyses, or witty wordplay?",
        coreConcept: "This measures how much your *mind* actively directs, shapes, or participates in the intimate experience. Are you all about being fully present in the physical moment, lost in the flow of sensation and emotion? Or do vivid internal fantasies, elaborate pre-planned stories, intricate psychological games, sharp and seductive banter, or the sheer abstract *idea* of a dynamic provide the main fuel for your fire?",
        elaboration: "Includes the full spectrum of mental involvement: from being totally grounded in immediate physical sensations and emotional feedback (low cognitive engagement) to inhabiting richly detailed, self-contained fantasy worlds, playing out complex character roles with specific motivations, loving strategic 'mind games' or psychological chess, getting profoundly fired up by clever, evocative language, or being intensely turned on by the *concept*, symbolism, or intellectual framework of a dynamic (high cognitive engagement). Your imagination might be the main stage!",
        scoreInterpretations: {
            "Very Low": "Headspace blissfully clear, focused on the here and now! You prefer being fully present, immersed in the unfolding physical feelings and emotional currents. Complex fantasies or intricate analyses might feel like distractions, pulling you out of the magic of the embodied moment. Presence is paramount.",
            "Low": "Mostly grounded in the present reality! You relish the immediate sensations and the connection happening right now. Maybe a fleeting scenario or image drifts by, but you're not actively directing a major internal movie; the physical reality and emotional exchange are the undisputed stars.",
            "Moderate": "A beautiful synergy between Mind and Body! You can savor being fully present, but also appreciate adding some mental spice to the mix – perhaps enjoying occasional light role-play, responding eagerly to dirty talk that paints a vivid picture, or getting intrigued by the underlying psychology of the interaction and dynamic.",
            "High": "Your brain is undeniably a major erogenous zone! Detailed fantasies running like internal films, specific role-play scenarios that require focus and character work, mentally navigating and playing with power dynamics, or engaging in sharp, seductive banter significantly amps up the arousal and engagement for you. The narrative and mental stimulation matter deeply!",
            "Very High": "Welcome to the grand Mind Palace – the primary theater of your desire! Your arousal might fundamentally *depend* on intricate, detailed scenarios, complex internal fantasy worlds with their own rules, intense psychological play (mind games!), or the sheer intellectual or symbolic *concept* of what's unfolding. The story playing out in your head is the main event, the engine driving the entire experience."
        },
        examples: "Think engagement like: Mindful, connected touch focusing purely on the flow of sensation (Low), loving descriptive dirty talk that builds entire worlds with words (Moderate), detailed D/s scenes with explicit rules, protocols, and assigned roles (High/Very High), immersive fantasy LARP-style encounters (High/Very High), getting deeply aroused by the act of writing or reading complex, psychologically nuanced erotica (High/Very High), engaging in intense, consensual psychological manipulation play based on deep trust and negotiation (Very High).",
        personaConnection: "How this shapes *your* unique sexy magic: It defines how much your thoughts, imagination, intellect, and love of narrative get in on the intimate action, potentially directing the entire show."
    },
    "Relational": {
        name: "Relational Context: The Constellation",
        coreQuestion: "What's your ideal celestial setup for intimacy? Who do you connect with, how many stars are in your sky, and what kind of orbits feel most natural and fulfilling?",
        coreConcept: "This describes your preferred 'social map' or 'constellation' for sex, intimacy, and relationships. How many partners feel right? What level of commitment resonates? Strangers passing like comets, or soulmates like binary stars? One-on-one orbits, or intricate galactic clusters involving multiple connections? It's about the structure where your intimate self thrives.",
        elaboration: "Covers the whole cosmic range of possibilities: navigating solo voyages of self-discovery and pleasure (masturbation), the focused intensity of traditional monogamy's twin stars, the diverse and fascinating flavors of ethical non-monogamy (like polyamory's complex interconnected systems or open relationships' defined freedoms and agreements), thrilling group encounters like temporary nebulae, anonymous sparks like distant supernovae, and everything in between. It's about finding the relational structure where your connections shine brightest and feel most authentic.",
        scoreInterpretations: {
            "Very Low": "Solo voyages or a 'just us two' universe feel most right! You likely prefer the focused intimacy of masturbation or a deeply bonded, exclusive partnership where emotional and sexual energy is intensely concentrated. Multiple partners or casual fly-bys might feel distracting, chaotic, or simply unappealing compared to that deep dyadic bond.",
            "Low": "Team Monogamy! You generally prefer, seek out, and feel most fulfilled within monogamous, committed relationships as the ideal setting for deep sexual and emotional expression. Casual connections are likely less appealing, infrequent, or perhaps seen as stepping stones towards finding that one exclusive partner.",
            "Moderate": "Flexible orbits and adaptable connections! Maybe you're deeply comfortable in a primary duo but remain open to occasional meteor showers (like swinging sometimes, exploring kinks outside the pair, or dating around before settling down). Or perhaps you value deep, meaningful bonds without needing strict lifelong exclusivity. Exploring non-monogamy cautiously, enjoying serial monogamy, or happily orbiting as Solo Poly could fit here.",
            "High": "More stars make a brighter, more complex sky (consensually, of course)! You prefer or actively practice relational structures involving multiple simultaneous partners or explicit openness, such as defined Open Relationships or various forms of Polyamory (which might be hierarchical with a primary, or more egalitarian). Open, honest communication about connections and boundaries is vital navigation equipment.",
            "Very High": "Charting your own unique cosmos, rejecting pre-drawn maps! You might strongly resonate with Relationship Anarchy (rejecting imposed rules and hierarchies, defining each bond uniquely!), embrace fully non-hierarchical Polyamory, delight in the complex energy of group dynamics, or feel comfortable navigating vastly different levels of commitment, intimacy, and entanglement across various partners simultaneously. 'One size fits all' definitely doesn't describe your intricate relational universe."
        },
        examples: "Think structures like: Masturbation (Solo self-discovery journey), Serial Monogamy (Successive chapters of exclusivity), Lifelong Monogamy (Enduring twin-star partnership), Friends With Benefits (Intimacy without romantic commitment), Open Relationships (Primary bond + negotiated freedom), Swinging (Couple-centric recreational play), Polyamorous constellations (Triads/Quads, Hierarchical structures, Egalitarian networks), Solo Polyamory (Independent core with multiple connections), Relationship Anarchy (Building unique connections without rules), Group Sex adventures (Shared momentary experiences), Anonymous encounters (Fleeting, low-stakes sparks).",
        personaConnection: "How this shapes *your* unique sexy magic: It defines your ideal 'relationship constellation' – the structure, number of partners, and types of connections within which your intimate self feels most authentic, expressed, and fulfilled (or if you prefer to shine brightly as a solitary star!)."
    },
    "RoleFocus": {
        name: "Role Focus: Energetic Polarity",
        coreQuestion: "Within power dynamics, where does your energy naturally resonate? Are you drawn to the assertive charge of Leading (Dominance), the receptive flow of Following (submission), or the dynamic interplay of Both (Switch)?",
        coreConcept: "This element explores your inherent energetic leaning within consensual power exchange dynamics. It's not just about specific acts, but about the underlying polarity: do you feel most energized, authentic, or fulfilled when embodying the guiding, initiating, 'yang' energy of Dominance? Or does the yielding, responsive, trusting 'yin' energy of submission feel like coming home? Or perhaps the versatile ability to inhabit both poles, fluidly shifting between them (Switching), is where your truest expression lies?",
        elaboration: "This measures your preference for energetic roles in scenarios involving explicit or implicit power differences. High scores indicate a strong resonance with Dominant/Leading/Giving energy (taking charge, making decisions, setting the pace, orchestrating). Low scores indicate a strong resonance with submissive/Following/Receiving energy (yielding control, trusting guidance, responding to direction, finding freedom in release). Mid-range scores suggest comfort with Switching roles, enjoying both perspectives, preferring egalitarian dynamics, or finding power irrelevant to the core experience.",
        scoreInterpretations: {
            "Very Low": "Profound resonance with submissive energy. You likely find deep satisfaction, freedom, or peace in yielding control, trusting completely, following intricate guidance, serving devotionally, or being the primary recipient of attention/sensation. Submission feels authentic.",
            "Low": "Comfortable in following roles. You may enjoy letting others lead, responding to clear cues, focusing on receiving pleasure, or supporting the dominant energy without needing to direct the flow yourself. Submissive or Bottom roles feel natural.",
            "Moderate": "Adaptable and versatile. You likely enjoy the interplay of giving and receiving, potentially swapping roles fluidly (Switch). Collaboration, egalitarian energy, or finding power dynamics less central to the core enjoyment fit here.",
            "High": "Strong resonance with Dominant energy. You likely enjoy taking initiative, guiding the interaction, setting the scene, generously providing care or sensation from a leading position, or being the clear authority figure. Dominant, Top, or Caregiver roles feel authentic.",
            "Very High": "Thriving in the Dominant pole. You feel most energized and fulfilled when fully embodying confident authority, meticulously controlling the environment and interaction, issuing clear commands, or taking ultimate responsibility for the experience. Leading feels natural and deeply satisfying."
        },
        examples: "Think roles like: Assertive Dominant [4], Devoted Submissive [5], Versatile Switch [6], Authoritative Master/Mistress [109], Obedient slave/pet [109], Skilled Top, Receptive Bottom, Nurturing Caregiver [58], Trusting Little [58], Egalitarian Partner, Primal Leader/Follower [40].",
        personaConnection: "How this shapes *your* unique sexy magic: It defines your preferred energetic polarity within power dynamics, revealing whether you thrive more naturally in the assertive current of Dominance, the receptive flow of submission, or the dynamic balance of Switching."
